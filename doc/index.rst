This module Simplifies the production orders in cases where you do not need an intermediate step of picking, the gathering of the available components in the stock and the movement to the production area.


The module lets check the availability of the material directly from the production order and determine whether production is possible or not. The development has been designed following the normal flow of the application and respecting the use of supplies, allowing the calculation of the supplies or the planned application, also the module lets change the status of planned production orders if they can be done and send the purchase or production orders required to start production.


If you want to prioritize a production order, the module allows the cancellation of the reserved components and releasing them for the priority order.
